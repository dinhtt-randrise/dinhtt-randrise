 o Goal: The goal of the competition is to develop a model that 
detects personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing.
 o Efficiency Prize: They are hosting a second track that 
focuses on model efficiency, because highly accurate models are 
often computationally heavy. Such models have a stronger carbon footprint 
and frequently prove difficult to utilize in real-world educational contexts. 
They hope to use these models to help educational organizations that 
have limited computational capabilities.
